# ðŸ«€ Heart Disease Prediction using Naive Bayes

This project uses a machine learning approach to predict whether a patient is likely to have heart disease. It utilizes the **Naive Bayes algorithm** on a cleaned dataset containing various medical attributes.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

- Predicts heart disease based on 11 key features such as age, sex, chest pain type, cholesterol, and ECG results.
- Uses **Gaussian Naive Bayes** from `scikit-learn`.
- Converts categorical variables to numeric using `map()`.
- Accepts **user input** and provides a prediction.
- Evaluates model performance with accuracy score.

---

## ðŸ§  Algorithm Used

- **Naive Bayes Classifier (GaussianNB)**
  - Assumes features follow a normal distribution.
  - Simple and fast, works well for small to medium-sized datasets.
